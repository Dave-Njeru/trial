Practice account  for learning Git - Meta

This project was a key component of the Meta Front-end Developer online certification program, specifically focusing on the version control module. The primary objective was to provide hands-on experience with Git, a widely used version control system in software development. By engaging in this project, participants aimed to enhance their skills in managing and tracking changes in their codebase, a crucial competency for modern front-end developers.

The project emphasized a practical approach, requiring all operations to be performed using Git Bash, a command-line interface for Git on Windows. This approach ensured that participants gained proficiency in using Git commands directly, without relying on graphical user interfaces. By working through various Git operations in the command line, students were able to develop a deeper understanding of Git's underlying principles and workflow, preparing them for real-world development scenarios where version control plays a vital role.
